   <h2>Overview</h2>
   <div class="hyphenate">
    <p>
     The clinical decision support track investigates techniques for linking
     medical records to information relevant for patient care.
    </p>
    <p>
     In making clinical decisions, physicians often seek out information about
     how to best care for their patients. Information relevant to a physician
     can be related to a variety of clinical tasks such as determining a
     patient's most likely diagnosis given a list of symptoms, deciding on the
     most effective treatment plan for a patient having a known condition, and
     determining if a particular test is indicated for a given situation. In
     some cases, physicians can find the information they seek in published
     biomedical literature. However, given the volume of the existing
     literature and the rapid pace at which new research is published,
     locating the most relevant and timely information for a particular
     clinical need can be a daunting and time-consuming task.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to make biomedical information more accessible and to meet the
     requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records, a goal
     of clinical decision support systems is to anticipate the needs of
     physicians by linking medical cases with information relevant for patient
     care. The goal of the clinical decision support track is to simulate the
     requirements of such systems and encourage the creation of tools and
     resources necessary for their implementation.
